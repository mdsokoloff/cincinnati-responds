<h1 id="contribute">Contribute</h1>

<p>Please help us add content to the website! This is intended as a community
project and a community resource, so please discuss in the “Science
Responds” Slack organization and contribute to the website content. For
the latter, we are interested in contributions about possible projects,
links to relevant articles and papers, “primers” which explain relevant
topics for a non-expert (but technically knowledgeable) audience, links
to COVID-19 relevant events, etc. Please look at what is on the website (and
what isn’t, including new categories of information) and fill in the holes.</p>

<p>The source for the website is here: <a href="https://github.com/science-responds/science-responds.github.io-source">https://github.com/science-responds/science-responds.github.io-source</a>. The README describes local previews and some of the basic site layout. We use Jekyll to build the site, and the Liquid template engine to build the data-powered pages, like projects and articles.</p>

<h3 id="quick-change">Quick change</h3>

<p>The smallest and simplest additions can be made through GitHub’s edit interface. Just go to the page (probably in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pages</code> folder) that you want to edit, and then click the pencil-like icon at the top right. Make your change, then save - GitHub will make a “fork” with your changes, and make a pull request with those changes. Even the most experienced of us sometimes to this to save time!</p>

<h3 id="occasional-changes">Occasional changes</h3>

<p>If you plan to make larger changes, manually make a fork (very top right in GitHub’s UI), then make your changes there <em>preferably in a new branch</em> (makes updating later easier for you and checking your work out easier for maintainers). Then make a pull request to our repository.</p>

<p>The README has instructions for setting up a local development environment, so you can preview your changes live.</p>

<h3 id="frequent-contributor">Frequent contributor</h3>

<p>If you plan to contribute more often, please ask us and we can probably add you to the master repository so that you can make branches without a fork.</p>
