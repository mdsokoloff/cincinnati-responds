<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>This website was built to facilitate interaction between COVID-19 researchers
and the broader science community. We are working to identify various relevant
research projects and list them on this site, as well how the community
can contribute in a constructive and impactful fashion.</p>

<p>As part of this
we are also working to organize small seminars and discussions with some 
COVID19 groups and researchers in a coherent fashion that allows them to
be maximally effective with their time.</p>
