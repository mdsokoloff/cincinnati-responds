<p>Recent efforts related to the coronavirus at UC Santa Cruz are described at <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/coronavirus-research.html">this</a> and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/vargas-pandemic.html">this</a> news release (more to follow).</p>

<p>Highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establishing a diagnostic testing lab at UC Santa Cruz as quickly as possible, aiming for a turnaround time within 24 hours.</li>
  <li>Adapting novel optical sensing technologies including an “optofluidic chip” to provide rapid detection of the coronavirus.</li>
  <li>Posted the genome sequence of the coronavirus with ongoing analysis and annotations on the UC Santa Cruz Genome Browser to enable rapid sequencing of coronavirus samples using the nanopore sequencing technology and to study T cell responses to the virus that could be useful for vaccine development.</li>
  <li>Building a “contact tracing” app for Peru.</li>
</ul>
