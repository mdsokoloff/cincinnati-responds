<h3>COVID-19 Risk</h3>
</div>
<p>This project is focusing on research that could lead to an app that shows
individuals their risk of COVID-19 infection based off GPS data, known cases,
and Bluetooth proximity networks. They aim to do so in a way that preserves
transparency and personal privacy. This is a  group of volunteers researching
and designing an open-source app to make this idea a reality. Ideally, this app
will take the GPS and Bluetooth data of users in an anonymised way, as well as
some information about their potential or confirmed infection status, and use
it to the benefit of both them and everybody else. There are several ways this
could happen: through secure and anonymous <a href="http://covid19risk.com/CSCT.pdf">contact
tracing</a>, through the creation of a risk
<a href="http://covid19risk.com/heatmap">heatmap</a>, and through more accurate
epidemiological modelling.</p>

<h3>COVID Care Map</h3>
</div>
<p>This project aims to understand, anticipate, and act to support and ramp up our health systems’ capacity (beds, staffing, ventilators, supplies) to effectively care for a rapidly growing number of active COVID19 patients in need of hospitalization and intensive (ICU) care. We do open-source data collection, geospatial analysis, visualizations, and scenario-planning tools aimed at informing resource planning and deployment decisionmaking to support our healthcare providers at local, county, &amp; state scale when and where the needs are greatest. USA-centric at the moment but tools and knowhow are intended to be applicable globally.</p>

<h3>Folding at Home</h3>
</div>
<p>Folding at Home uses computer simulations to understand the proteins that viruses use to 
reproduce and suppress immune systems. This is done by taking the experimental structures 
as starting points, we can simulate how all the atoms in the protein move. Doing so can 
help health researchers find and understand new therapeutic opportunities. The 
calculations involved in these simulations are enormous, and so volunteers can use their 
existing compute resources to run folding simulations in the background and contribute 
to the larger F@H database.</p>

<h3>Project Open Air (Just One Giant Lab)</h3>
</div>
<p>Project Open Air/Helpful Engineers, hosted within the broader open science
group Just One Giant Lab has created a 5,000 strong volunteer organization,
with engineers, scientists and doctors around the world who work to
organize themselves into teams to design innovative ways to fight the
virus. They are quickly trying to design and arrange the production of
pragmatic devices to move life-saving air, extend existing tools, or
organize volunteers on the ground to bolster medical workers. They have
both hardware and software based projects including designing open source,
scalable easy to DIY ventilators and O2 concentrators, sentiment analysis
for persuasive public health media, diagnostic apps, and more!</p>
