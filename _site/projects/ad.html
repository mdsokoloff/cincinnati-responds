<h3>CHIME: COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics</h3>
</div>
<p>As we prepare for the additional demands that the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">COVID-19
outbreak</a> will place
on our hospital system, our operational leaders need up-to-date projections
of what additional resources will be required. Informed estimates of how
many patients will need hospitalization, ICU beds, and mechanical
ventilation over the coming days and weeks will be crucial inputs to
readiness responses and mitigation strategies.To this end, the <a href="http://predictivehealthcare.pennmedicine.org/">Predictive
Healthcare</a> team at Penn
Medicine has developed a tool that leverages <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SIRModel.html">SIR
modeling</a> to assist hospitals
with capacity planning around COVID-19.
<a href="https://github.com/pennsignals/chime">CHIME</a> allows hospitals to enter
information about their population and modify assumptions around the spread
and behavior of COVID-19. It then runs a standard SIR model to project the
number of new hospital admissions each day, along with the daily hospital
census. These projections can then be used to create best- and worst-case
scenarios to assist with capacity planning. It is currently being used by a
few hospitals and they’re looking to expand!</p>

<h3>COVID-19 Risk</h3>
</div>
<p>This project is focusing on research that could lead to an app that shows
individuals their risk of COVID-19 infection based off GPS data, known cases,
and Bluetooth proximity networks. They aim to do so in a way that preserves
transparency and personal privacy. This is a  group of volunteers researching
and designing an open-source app to make this idea a reality. Ideally, this app
will take the GPS and Bluetooth data of users in an anonymised way, as well as
some information about their potential or confirmed infection status, and use
it to the benefit of both them and everybody else. There are several ways this
could happen: through secure and anonymous <a href="http://covid19risk.com/CSCT.pdf">contact
tracing</a>, through the creation of a risk
<a href="http://covid19risk.com/heatmap">heatmap</a>, and through more accurate
epidemiological modelling.</p>

<h3>Folding at Home</h3>
</div>
<p>Folding at Home uses computer simulations to understand the proteins that viruses use to 
reproduce and suppress immune systems. This is done by taking the experimental structures 
as starting points, we can simulate how all the atoms in the protein move. Doing so can 
help health researchers find and understand new therapeutic opportunities. The 
calculations involved in these simulations are enormous, and so volunteers can use their 
existing compute resources to run folding simulations in the background and contribute 
to the larger F@H database.</p>

<h3>COVID Compare</h3>
</div>
<p>This project is just kicking off and is working on tracking/mapping the
relative risk of Covid19 in the US. 50 cases in Kentucky is not the same as
50 cases in NYC. People aren’t good at normalizing out other variables like
population/hospital access so I want to do that for them visually.</p>

<h3>Project Open Air (Just One Giant Lab)</h3>
</div>
<p>Project Open Air/Helpful Engineers, hosted within the broader open science
group Just One Giant Lab has created a 5,000 strong volunteer organization,
with engineers, scientists and doctors around the world who work to
organize themselves into teams to design innovative ways to fight the
virus. They are quickly trying to design and arrange the production of
pragmatic devices to move life-saving air, extend existing tools, or
organize volunteers on the ground to bolster medical workers. They have
both hardware and software based projects including designing open source,
scalable easy to DIY ventilators and O2 concentrators, sentiment analysis
for persuasive public health media, diagnostic apps, and more!</p>
