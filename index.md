##  Cincinnati  Responds 

June 10, 2020

Two challenges are front and center in the United States today. The novel coronavirus is having 
enormous public health and economic impacts.
Police (and other) violence targeting Black Americans has entered the general consciousness
at a level not matched since the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
Addressing these issues usefully will require sustained efforts built on commonly
accepted facts, shared interests, and mutual respect.
This web site is intended to serve as a trustworthy source of information and to provide
links to reliable information and thoughtful analyses.

The coronavirus continues to spread around the world and risks
overwhelming the health systems in many countries. 
In the state of Ohio, more than 2400 residents have died already.
We hope that you
are well and are taking the necessary steps to protect yourselves,
your families, and your community.
The economic impact of sheltering-in-place has been devastating.
As the state re-opens, recovery is likely to be slow.
No one knows whether the rate of infection will grow or diminish in the
near future, nor when an effective and safe vaccine will be available.
Despite the resulting uncertainties, all of us need to make practical
day-to-day and month-to-month decisions, whether we are individuals,
business or community leaders, or politicians or administrators with
relevant responsibilities.

Slavery is commonly called the original sin of the United States.
Historically, it long preceded the formation of an independent nation
in North America. It was formally incorporated into the Constitution
despite the aspirational words of the Declaration of Independence: 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, 
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
The video images of a policeman killing George Floyd, along with
video images showing Ahmaud Arbery being hunted and killed 
 have awakened the American consciousness
to the violence experienced every day by so many Black people
in this country.
Changing this reality will require long-term efforts by all of us,
starting with 
practical day-to-day and month-to-month decisions, whether we are individuals, 
business or community leaders, or politicians or administrators with 
relevant responsibilities.

While no virus knows the race or ethnicity of its host, social conditions
can produce significantly different outcomes for different
populations.
The U.S. Census Bureau identifies 82% of Ohio's population as White
and 13% as Black 
or African American. 
Where race has been reported,
the Ohio Department of Health reports 1929 Covid-19 deaths for Whites and 
446 for Blacks.
The apparently higher rate for Blacks might be ascribed to statistical fluctuations,
all else being equal.
However, for residents under the age of 70, the difference is stark:
153 Black deaths compared to 350 White deaths.
Two conclusions appear to explain why the Black death rate from Covid-19 for
those under age 70 is three times as large as the corresponding White death rate:
(i) the fraction of the Black population over the age of 70 is much lower than the
fraction of the White population that old, and
(ii) in every age range, 
it appears that the rate at which Blacks contract the virus is much higher than that for
Whites.




 


  1. Make connections to enable (non-medical) researchers to contribute to
     understanding and combating this global problem and/or its economic and
     societal impacts. How can researchers with significant data analytics,
     machine learning, simulation, software, computing, hardware development 
     and organizational
     skills contribute? Are there places where marshaling large "Big
     Science"-style distributed teams to tackle problems can be useful?

  2. Explore how all types of research activities can adapt and be effective in
     an era in which face-to-face meetings and travel are greatly reduced and
     conferences are being canceled. What are the lessons being learned and new
     ideas for how to approach this? TESTING.

The website provides links to various information sources on COVID-19 related
research, resources and research projects. We are also actively engaged
through discussion in the Slack channel and periodic meetings in building
further connections and enabling related discussions.
